# BSDMDA-Capstone-Project
After randomly sending nearly 32,000 letters to community members, nonprofit organization Sunshine Benevolence Fund discovered that every donation received was contributed by individuals earning an annual income exceeding $50,000. The organization needed a method that could effectively identify potential donors while minimizing the cost of outreach. This project compared supervised machine learning algorithms to create an accurate model capable of predicting whether an individual earns more than $50,000. The project also sought to accept or reject the null hypothesis that Sunshine Benevolence Fund could not significantly improve its ability to efficiently reach potential donors by using predictive analytics.

In this project, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation were conducted using the Python programming language within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset used was a previously cleaned CSV file extracted from the 1994 U.S. Census data. The solution included transforming features and splitting the data into training and testing sets. Machine learning models were trained and evaluated using training and prediction times, as well as accuracy and F-score metrics.

The best performing model was then optimized using grid search and cross-validation. Feature importance analysis was conducted to assess the significance of different features. A baseline was compared with the supervised learning algorithm, and a hypothesis test was performed to determine if predictive analytics could significantly improve the charity's ability to efficiently reach potential donors compared to their current approach.

As a result of my analysis, I was able to deliver a model that could be used to predict individual income levels with a high degree of accuracy. Sunshine Benevolence Fund will greatly benefit from using this model to identify potential donors. The charity had been randomly sending letters to solicit donations, wasting precious time, resources, and money. Once they discovered that only individuals making over $50,000 per year were donating to them, they decided to act. I calculated that only 25% of individuals in the dataset made more than this amount, indicating that the organization was making the right decision in trying to stop the wasteful practice of mailing random letters. The naive predictor benchmarks of 25% accuracy and 29% F-score are consistent with this income analysis, so I made that accuracy score the baseline. The optimized model's accuracy on the testing data was 87%, while its F-score was 75%, a significant improvement. The results of a paired t-test allowed me to easily reject the null hypothesis. After developing and evaluating the final model, I can confidently say that its implementation can help the charity become significantly more efficient at reaching potential donors.
